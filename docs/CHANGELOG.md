# Changelog

All notable changes to AgenticAuthor will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Inline Project Selection**
  - `/open` command now shows numbered list for selection (no modal)
  - Displays project metadata (genre, word count, last updated)
  - Type number to select, Enter to cancel
  - Can still provide project name directly as argument
  - Follows Claude Code UI patterns - everything inline

### Fixed
- **Tab Completion**
  - Tab now immediately completes when there's only one match instead of showing a menu
  - Changed `complete_while_typing` to `False` so completions only show on Tab press
  - Example: `/op` + Tab → immediately completes to `/open` (no menu needed)
- **Async Error in `/open` Command**
  - Fixed "asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop" error
  - Changed `open_project` to async and use `run_async()` for radiolist dialog

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-23

### Added
- **Enhanced Premise Generation**
  - Genre-specific taxonomy support for 11 genres (fantasy, sci-fi, romance, mystery, horror, etc.)
  - Smart input detection (brief premise vs standard vs detailed vs treatment)
  - History tracking to avoid repetitive generations
  - Interactive genre selection with fallback prompts
  - Automatic genre normalization and alias support
  - Preservation of existing treatments (200+ words)
- **Advanced Command Completion**
  - Tab completion for all slash commands
  - Genre autocomplete for `/generate premise` command
  - Model fuzzy search and tab completion
  - Context-aware completion suggestions
- **Comprehensive Logging System**
  - Debug logging to `~/.agentic/logs/agentic_YYYYMMDD.log`
  - `/logs` command to view recent log entries
  - Automatic daily log rotation
  - Full error tracking and debugging support
- **Taxonomy System** (`src/generation/taxonomies.py`)
  - TaxonomyLoader for managing genre-specific parameters
  - PremiseAnalyzer for input type detection
  - PremiseHistory for tracking generations
  - Support for base + genre-specific taxonomy merging
- **Test Suite Expansion**
  - 187 total tests (171 unit, 16 integration)
  - Real API integration tests with grok-4-fast model
  - 100% coverage attempt for core modules
  - Tests for all new features

### Changed
- PremiseGenerator now supports multiple generation modes based on input length
- Model parameter follows fallback chain: specified → project → settings
- Enhanced `/generate premise` command with genre and concept parsing
- Improved error messages and user feedback

### Fixed
- Model attribute error in PremiseGenerator instantiation
- Tab completion not triggering on Tab key press
- Mouse selection issues in terminal (added shift+drag support note)
- CompleteStyle import error from prompt_toolkit
- API key validation expecting boolean instead of exceptions
- TokenUsageTracker import error (removed non-existent class)

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-23

- OpenRouter API client with streaming support
- Interactive REPL with prompt_toolkit
- Slash command system with auto-completion
- Project and story data models
- Git integration for version control
- Configuration management with .env support
- Model discovery and selection

### Changed
- Commands now use `/` prefix (e.g., `/help` instead of `help`)
- Natural language input (without `/`) reserved for iteration

### Fixed
- InteractiveSession initialization order bug
- DateTime deprecation warnings (using timezone-aware UTC)
- Taxonomy serialization issues
- Test console compatibility issues

### Security
- API key validation (must start with 'sk-or-')
