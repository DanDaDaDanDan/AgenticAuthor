# Prose.py Quality-First Refactor Plan

**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: In Progress (60% complete)
**Commit**: 82069da (foundation complete)

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Word count targets cause LLMs to artificially fragment and duplicate content.

**Root Cause**:
```python
num_scenes = len(key_events)  # key_events = 9 plot points
prompt = "This chapter has 9 SCENES to develop..."
```
Result: LLM creates 9 separate dramatic scenes → 9 "reversals" → massive duplication

**Solution**: Quality-first architecture
- Remove all word count pressure from prompts
- Let LLM determine natural scene structure (2-4 scenes typically)
- Focus on "write excellently" not "write exactly N words"
- Chapters breathe based on content, not arithmetic

---

## Progress Report

### ✅ COMPLETED (Committed: 82069da)

1. **depth_calculator.py** (566 → 284 lines, 50% reduction)
   - ✅ Removed: Word budgeting, scene budgets, beat calculations, glue fractions
   - ✅ Kept: Chapter count calc, act distribution, peak roles
   - ✅ New method: `calculate_chapter_structure()` returns structural guidance only

2. **wordcount.py** (DELETED - 361 lines removed)
   - ✅ File deleted
   - ✅ `/wordcount` command removed from interactive.py
   - ✅ Autocomplete entry removed

3. **prose.py Validation** (Simplified)
   - ✅ Removed word count validation
   - ✅ Changed from "missing_scene" to "missing_moment"
   - ✅ Added "Natural variation in prose length" to ALLOWED criteria
   - ✅ Removed scene_coverage and word_count_check from JSON schema

### 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**prose.py** - 3 remaining sections with word count logic:

1. **Lines 522-669**: Main generation prompt ← **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
2. **Lines 310-324**: Iteration prompt
3. **Lines 673-689**: Token estimation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### SECTION 1: Main Generation Prompt (Lines 522-669)

    scene_targets = [scene.get('target_words', 0) for scene in scenes]
    avg_ws = sum(scene_targets) // len(scene_targets) if scene_targets else word_count_target // num_scenes
else:
    avg_ws = word_count_target // num_scenes if num_scenes > 0 else 1500

setup_range = (int(avg_ws * 0.7), int(avg_ws * 0.9))
standard_range = (int(avg_ws * 0.9), int(avg_ws * 1.1))

```

**NEW QUALITY-FIRST CODE**:
```python
# Lines 522-540: Simplified - no word count math
# Support both structured scenes and simple key_events list
key_moments = current_chapter.get('scenes', current_chapter.get('key_events', []))
uses_structured_scenes = (
    'scenes' in current_chapter and
    isinstance(key_moments, list) and
    len(key_moments) > 0 and

        else:
            moments_list += f"- {event}\n"

# Lines 541-669: NEW QUALITY-FIRST PROMPT
prompt = f"""Generate excellent prose for a chapter using this story context.

STORY CONTEXT (chapters.yaml):
```yaml
{chapters_yaml}
```
{prev_summary}

CHAPTER TO WRITE:
- Chapter {chapter_number}: "{current_chapter['title']}"
- POV: {current_chapter.get('pov', 'N/A')}
- Act: {current_chapter.get('act', 'N/A')}

CHAPTER SUMMARY:
{chapter_summary}

KEY MOMENTS TO INCLUDE:
{moments_list}

YOUR MISSION:
Write this chapter as EXCELLENT PROSE.

Let each moment breathe naturally - don't rush or pad content.
Scenes end when they're complete, not when they hit a word count.
Show the story vividly through {current_chapter.get('pov', 'the character')}'s perspective.
Trust your narrative instincts over arithmetic.

STRUCTURE GUIDANCE:
- Natural scene breaks (typically 2-4 scenes for material like this)
- Progressive development, no repetition
- Each key moment happens ONCE, fully realized
- Let the story determine chapter length

SHOW vs TELL - CRITICAL:

❌ TELLING (summary - avoid):
"Sarah was angry about the birthday. She confronted him and he apologized."
(20 words - rushed)

✅ SHOWING (full scene - do):
Sarah's jaw clenched as Mark walked in, whistling. Her birthday. Her thirtieth. Forgotten.

"Hey," he said. "What's for dinner?"

The question hit like a slap. She'd waited all day. "You're kidding."

"What?" He opened the fridge, oblivious.

"Mark." Her voice came out flat. "What day is it?"

He paused. His eyes widened. "Oh God. Sarah, I—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Just don't."

(380 words - full scene with emotion, dialogue, action)

GUIDELINES:
1. Use metadata (tone, pacing, themes) to guide your voice
2. Draw on character backgrounds and motivations
3. Use world-building details to ground scenes
4. Perfect continuity from previous chapters
5. Narrative style: {metadata.get('narrative_style', narrative_style)}
6. SHOW emotions through action, dialogue, physical reactions
7. Include sensory details (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste)
8. Let dialogue breathe - reactions, pauses, processing
9. Honor act context ({current_chapter.get('act', 'N/A')}):
   - Act I: Efficient but full scenes
   - Act II: Standard dramatic development
   - Act III: Deeper emotional intensity

These guidelines serve the story. Prioritize what makes the prose excellent.
You have creative latitude when prescriptive details conflict with narrative flow.

Return ONLY the prose text. Do NOT include:
- YAML formatting
- Chapter headers (we'll add those)
- Explanations or notes
- Scene markers or dividers

Just flowing narrative prose - write the best version of this chapter."""
```

**Changes Summary**:
- ❌ Removed: `word_count_target`, `num_scenes = len(key_events)`, all word count math
- ❌ Removed: "MINIMUM words per scene", word count arithmetic, scene fragmentation
- ✅ Added: Chapter summary, key moments list (not "9 SCENES")
- ✅ Focus: "Write excellently" not "write 3,847 words"
- ✅ Natural: "2-4 scenes typically" instead of counting events

---

### SECTION 2: Iteration Prompt (Lines 310-324 of validation iteration)

**Current Code** (lines in iteration section, around 530):
```python
word_count_target = current_chapter.get('word_count_target', 3000)
scenes = current_chapter.get('scenes', current_chapter.get('key_events', []))
num_scenes = len(scenes)

iteration_prompt = f"""{iteration_feedback}

TARGET: {word_count_target:,} words total = {num_scenes} full dramatic scenes

Return ONLY the corrected prose text...
Just the flowing narrative prose ({word_count_target:,} words, {num_scenes} full dramatic scenes)."""
```

**NEW CODE**:
```python
iteration_prompt = f"""{iteration_feedback}

Write the corrected prose as excellent narrative.
Let the content breathe naturally.

Return ONLY the corrected prose text. Do NOT include:
- YAML formatting
- Chapter headers
- Explanations or notes

Just flowing narrative prose."""
```

**Changes**:
- ❌ Remove: All word_count_target and num_scenes references
- ✅ Simplify: Focus on quality, not quantity

---

### SECTION 3: Token Estimation (Lines 673-689)

**Current Code**:
```python
from ..utils.tokens import estimate_messages_tokens
estimated_response_tokens = word_count_target + 500  # ~1 token per word + buffer

result = await self.client.streaming_completion(
    ...
    min_response_tokens=estimated_response_tokens
)
```

**NEW CODE**:
```python
from ..utils.tokens import estimate_messages_tokens
# Estimate generous response space (typical chapter: 3000-5000 words)
estimated_response_tokens = 5000  # Reasonable default for quality prose

result = await self.client.streaming_completion(
    ...
    min_response_tokens=estimated_response_tokens
)
```

**Changes**:
- ❌ Remove: Dependency on word_count_target
- ✅ Use: Fixed generous estimate (chapters vary naturally)

---

### SECTION 4: calculate_prose_context_tokens() Method (Lines 337-437)

**Current Code** (lines 375-383):
```python
# Get target words for current chapter
target_words = 3000  # default
for ch in chapters:
    if ch.get('number') == chapter_number:
        target_words = ch.get('word_count_target', 3000)
        break

# Response space needed (1.3x target words)
response_needed = int(target_words * 1.3)
```

**NEW CODE**:
```python
# Response space needed (generous for quality prose)
# Typical chapters: 3000-5000 words, allow flexibility
response_needed = 6000  # ~4500 words of prose + buffer
```

**Changes**:
- ❌ Remove: Chapter-specific word_count_target lookup
- ✅ Use: Fixed generous estimate that works for all chapters

**Alternative** (if method is critical for model selection):
```python
# Keep method but simplify
response_needed = 6000  # Standard generous estimate

return {
    ...
    "response_tokens": response_needed,
    "total_needed": total_context + response_needed + 1000,
    # Remove "target_words" from return dict entirely
}
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Complete prose.py Refactor
```bash
# Edit prose.py lines 522-669 (main prompt)
# Edit prose.py lines 530 (iteration prompt)
# Edit prose.py lines 673-689 (token estimation)
# Edit prose.py lines 375-383 (context calculation)

# Test: Ensure no references to word_count_target remain
grep -n "word_count_target\|num_scenes\|avg_ws" src/generation/prose.py
```

### Step 2: Update chapters.py
Remove `word_count_target` field from chapter YAML generation.

**Files to check**:
- `src/generation/chapters.py` - Chapter generation prompts
- Look for: `word_count_target:` in YAML templates

**Changes needed**:
```yaml
# BEFORE
chapters:
  - number: 1
    title: "..."
    act: "Act I"
    role: "inciting_setup"
    word_count_target: 3800  # ← REMOVE THIS

# AFTER
chapters:
  - number: 1
    title: "..."
    act: "Act I"
    role: "inciting_setup"
    # No word_count_target field
```

### Step 3: Update Other Generation Files
Check for word count references:

```bash
# Search for word count references
grep -r "word_count\|target_words\|WORDS_PER" src/generation/ --include="*.py"

# Files to check:
# - lod_context.py
# - analysis/*.py
# - copy_editor.py
# - short_story.py
# - treatment.py (keep - it's a planning doc)
```

### Step 4: Update Documentation
- CLAUDE.md - Remove word count architecture sections
- Update examples to show quality-first approach
- Document new simplified depth_calculator

### Step 5: Final Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete: Quality-first prose generation architecture

FIXES ROOT CAUSE OF DUPLICATION BUG:
- Removed num_scenes = len(key_events) fragmentation
- Removed all word count pressure from prompts
- Focus on 'write excellently' not 'write N words'

Changes:
- prose.py: Rewritten generation prompts (quality-first)
- chapters.py: Remove word_count_target field
- All files: Remove word count references
- Documentation: Updated architecture

Result:
- Natural scene structure (2-4 scenes based on content)
- No artificial fragmentation
- No repetitive 'reversals'
- Chapters breathe based on story needs

Total reduction: ~800 lines of complexity removed"
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Before/After Comparison

**BEFORE (with bug)**:
```
Input: Chapter with 9 key_events
Prompt: "This chapter has 9 SCENES to develop"
LLM creates: 9 separate dramatic scenes
Result: Body examination happens 9 times
Word count: 50-60% of target (rushed summaries)
```

**AFTER (quality-first)**:
```
Input: Chapter with 9 key moments
Prompt: "Write excellent prose. Key moments: [list]"
LLM creates: 2-4 natural scenes covering all moments
Result: Body examination happens ONCE, fully developed
Word count: Varies naturally (2k-5k based on content)
```

### Manual Test Plan

1. **Generate new prose** for chapter with old key_events format
   - Verify: No duplication
   - Verify: All key moments covered
   - Verify: Natural scene structure

2. **Check existing books** don't break
   - Backward compatibility with old chapters.yaml
   - Prose generation still works

3. **Verify removal**:
   ```bash
   # Should find ZERO matches in generation files:
   grep -r "word_count_target" src/generation/*.py | grep -v "# REMOVE"
   grep -r "num_scenes.*=.*len" src/generation/*.py
   ```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **No duplication**: Body examination happens ONCE per chapter
✅ **Natural flow**: 2-4 scenes per chapter based on content
✅ **Quality focus**: Prompts emphasize excellence, not word counts
✅ **Simplification**: ~800 lines of complexity removed
✅ **Backward compat**: Existing books still generate prose
✅ **Clean codebase**: No word_count_target references in generation logic

---

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Chapters too short or too long
- **Mitigation**: LLMs naturally write 3-5k word chapters for novel content
- **Fallback**: Can add rough guidance ("typically 3-5k words") without targets

**Risk 2**: Missing key moments
- **Mitigation**: Validation still checks for missing moments
- **Already implemented**: prose validation checks all moments covered

**Risk 3**: User expects exact word counts
- **Mitigation**: Document new philosophy in CLAUDE.md
- **Communication**: "Chapters breathe naturally, focus on quality"

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Step 1** (prose.py refactor): 30-45 min
- **Step 2** (chapters.py update): 15-20 min
- **Step 3** (other files check): 15-20 min
- **Step 4** (documentation): 10-15 min
- **Step 5** (testing + commit): 10-15 min

**Total**: 80-115 minutes for complete refactor

---

## Notes

- Foundation is solid (60% complete, committed)
- Validation already simplified (no word count checks)
- Main work is prose.py prompt rewrite
- High confidence this fixes duplication bug
- Aligns with user's original insight: "give LLM summary and creative freedom"

**Next session**: Continue from Step 1 (prose.py refactor)
