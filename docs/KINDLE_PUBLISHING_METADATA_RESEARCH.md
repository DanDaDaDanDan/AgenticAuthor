---

## 2. Book Description Best Practices

### Character Limits
- **Maximum**: 4,000 characters (Amazon's hard limit)
- **Optimal**: 150-300 words (~800-1,600 characters)
- **Key principle**: Be compelling and scannable, not exhaustive
- Shorter, focused descriptions often convert better than long ones

### Core Structure

#### For Fiction:

**1. Hook (First 1-2 sentences)**
   - Grab attention immediately
   - Set tone and genre
   - First line crucial (visible before "read more" on mobile)
   - Examples:
     - "She has one week to find her sister's killer—or become the next victim."
     - "In a world where memories can be stolen, one thief refuses to forget."

**2. Main Conflict/Stakes (2 paragraphs)**
   - Introduce protagonist
   - Present central conflict
   - Raise emotional stakes
   - DO NOT spoil plot twists
   - Use "they" or character names, avoid "you"
   - Focus on: What does the character want? What's stopping them? What happens if they fail?

**3. Mood/Theme Keywords**
   - Naturally integrate genre keywords
   - Include mood adjectives (haunting, thrilling, heartwarming)
   - Mention themes (redemption, betrayal, survival)

**4. Comparable Titles (Optional)**
   - "Fans of [X] will love..."
   - "Perfect for readers who enjoyed [Y]"
   - Use recent titles (last 5 years), not mega-bestsellers

**5. Call to Action**
   - Simple ending encouraging purchase
   - "Discover..." / "Experience..." / "Join [character] on..."

#### For Nonfiction:

**1. Hook (Problem Statement)**
   - Identify reader's pain point or challenge
   - Use "you" to make it personal
   - Make reader feel understood

**2. Solution (Your Book)**
   - Position book as the answer
   - Focus on BENEFITS, not features
   - What will reader gain/achieve/learn?

**3. Credentials**
   - Establish authority
   - Mention relevant expertise, awards, previous works
   - More critical for nonfiction than fiction

**4. Social Proof (If Available)**
   - Awards, bestseller status
   - NOT reviews/testimonials (forbidden as of May 2024)

**5. Call to Action**
   - Encourage transformation
   - "Learn how to..." / "Discover the secrets..."

### Formatting Guidelines

**Allowed HTML Tags:**
- `<br>` - Line breaks
- `<p>` - Paragraphs
- `<b>` - Bold text (use for hook, CTAs, key phrases)
- `<em>` or `<i>` - Italics
- `<u>` - Underline
- `<h4>` to `<h6>` - Headers (use sparingly)
- `<ol>` and `<ul>` - Numbered/bulleted lists

**Formatting Best Practices:**
- **Bold your hook** - First sentence in bold
- **Short paragraphs** - 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Visual breaks** - Use spacing to create scannable sections
- **Mix formatting** - Bold, italics, breaks for visual hierarchy
- **Mobile-friendly** - Most readers shop on phones

### What NOT to Include

**Strictly Forbidden:**
- Reviews, quotes, or testimonials (as of May 2024)
- Contact information (email, website, social media)
- Promotional content (sales, discounts, time-sensitive info)
- Spoilers
- Unicode emojis
- Keyword stuffing or book tags
- Pornographic or offensive content
- Amazon program names ("Kindle Unlimited", "KDP Select")

## 3. Keywords Strategy

### The Basics

**Amazon gives you 7 keyword boxes:**
- Each box can hold up to 50 characters
- Can be single words or phrases
- Phrases should be 2-3 words long
- Keywords are NOT visible to customers

### Keyword Selection Strategy

**1. Start with Amazon Search**
   - Use Amazon's search bar autocomplete
   - Type your genre + topic, see what Amazon suggests
   - These suggestions = what readers actually search for

**2. Target Specificity**
   - Specific words beat general words
   - "space opera romance" > "science fiction"
   - "cozy mystery bakery" > "mystery"

**3. Balance Volume and Competition**
   - High search volume = more potential readers
   - Low competition = easier to rank
   - Use tools like Publisher Rocket (paid) or Keyword Tool Dominator (free)

**4. Category-Reinforcing Keywords**
   - Use 1-2 of your 7 keywords to target/reinforce categories
   - Helps Amazon understand your book's niche
   - Example: "urban fantasy werewolves" reinforces Urban Fantasy category

**5. Use All 7 Keyword Boxes**
   - Don't leave any empty
   - Each box is an opportunity for discovery

### What to AVOID in Keywords

- Don't use quotes (limits to exact phrase match)
- Don't include your book title or author name (redundant)
- Don't use Amazon program names (Kindle Unlimited, KDP Select)
- Don't repeat keywords across boxes
- Don't use category names (use actual search terms)
- Don't use trademarked terms

### Keyword Research Tools

**Free:**
- Amazon search autocomplete
- Amazon "Customers who bought this also bought"
- Keyword Tool Dominator (Amazon Books department)

**Paid:**
- Publisher Rocket (formerly KDP Rocket) - Most popular
- KDP Spy
- Book Bolt

### Example Keyword Strategy (Urban Fantasy)

Box 1: `urban fantasy romance paranormal`
Box 2: `witches magic supernatural thriller`
Box 3: `strong female protagonist fantasy`
Box 4: `dark fantasy urban setting`
Box 5: `enemies to lovers paranormal romance`
Box 6: `fast paced action adventure fantasy`
Box 7: `magical realism contemporary fantasy`

## 4. Categories & BISAC Codes

### Understanding the Systems

**BISAC Codes:**
- Industry standard classification (Book Industry Study Group)
- Used by libraries, wholesalers, databases
- You select up to 3 BISAC codes
- NOT visible on Amazon
- As of June 2023, Amazon uses its own category system

**Amazon Categories:**
- Amazon's own proprietary system
- More specific than BISAC
- Visible to customers
- Don't need to match BISAC exactly

### Selecting Categories

**Basic Rules:**
1. Choose up to **3 categories**
2. Be as **specific** as possible
3. Must accurately reflect book's **central storyline/topic**
4. Wrong categories = poor customer experience = lower sales

**Strategic Selection:**

**Option 1: Broad Reach**
- Choose 3 different category paths
- Example: Fiction > Fantasy > Urban, Fiction > Romance > Paranormal, Fiction > Action & Adventure

**Option 2: Niche Domination**
- Choose 3 very specific subcategories
- Less competitive = easier to become "bestseller" in that category
- Example: Fiction > Fantasy > Urban > Vampires

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- 1 broad category for visibility
- 2 specific subcategories for bestseller badges

### Finding the Right Categories

**Methods:**
1. **Browse Bestseller Lists**
   - Find successful books similar to yours
   - Check their categories (shown on product page)
   - If your book fits there, use those categories

2. **Use Category Browser**
   - Browse Amazon's category tree
   - Look for categories where your book would rank well

3. **Consider Competition**
   - Check bestseller rank of #1 in category
   - Lower bestseller rank = more competitive category
   - Find the sweet spot: relevant + achievable

### BISAC Category Levels

BISAC codes have hierarchical structure:
- **Level 1**: Broad (Fiction, Nonfiction, Juvenile)
- **Level 2**: Genre (Science Fiction, Mystery, Romance)
- **Level 3**: Subgenre (Space Opera, Cozy Mystery, Paranormal Romance)

**Example BISAC Path:**
`FIC028030` = Fiction > Science Fiction > Space Opera

### Important Notes

- Categories can be changed after publishing
- You can request additional categories by contacting KDP support
- Maximum 10 categories total (3 in dashboard + 7 via support)
- Keywords can help you appear in additional categories

## 5. Author Bio Best Practices

### Purpose

- Help readers connect with you
- Encourage them to follow/read more of your work

### Length
- **Optimal**: 100-200 words

- **Maximum**: No strict limit, but keep it engaging

### What to Include

**For Fiction Authors:**

### Tone

When not writing, [Author] [relevant hobby/interest] and lives in [location] with [family/pets]. Visit [website] for news about upcoming releases.

### Guidelines

**DO:**

- Choose books with similar:
  - Tone/mood
  - Themes
  - Target audience
  - Length/complexity
- Pick books that are successful but not mega-bestsellers
- Use 2-3 comp titles maximum
- Ensure books are in same genre

**DON'T:**

- Choose books significantly more famous than your target
- Use comps just because they're popular (must be genuinely similar)
- Compare yourself to "the greats" (Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, etc.)

### How to Find Comp Titles

   - Look at books similar to yours
   - Check what readers of those books also purchased
