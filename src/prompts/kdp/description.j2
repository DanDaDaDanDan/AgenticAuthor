REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: 100-150 words (~500-750 characters)
- Format: HTML with <b>, <i>, <br> tags
- Structure for fiction:
  * Hook (1-2 sentences) - Make it bold <b>
  * Main conflict and protagonist (2 paragraphs)
  * Stakes (what happens if they fail?)
  * Call to action
- Be compelling and scannable
- Make readers want to buy immediately

⚠️ CRITICAL ANTI-SPOILER RULES:
NEVER REVEAL:
- Plot twists, surprises, or revelations
- How conflicts resolve or who wins/loses
- Character deaths, betrayals, or major decisions
- The midpoint twist, climax, or ending
- Any information from Act II or Act III
- Character arc outcomes ("learns to trust", "becomes a hero", etc.)

ONLY INCLUDE:
- Setup: protagonist's starting situation
- Inciting incident: what disrupts their world
- Central conflict: what they must face/overcome
- Stakes: what they stand to lose
- Questions that make readers curious (don't answer them!)

GOOD EXAMPLE (no spoilers):
<b>She thought she knew her husband. She was wrong.</b><br><br>
When Emma discovers a hidden room in their new home, she uncovers evidence of a life her husband never mentioned. A different name. A different family. A past that officially doesn't exist.<br><br>
Now someone is watching her. Following her. Leaving messages only she can see. As Emma digs deeper, she must decide: Is her husband protecting her from the truth—or is he the one she should fear?

BAD EXAMPLE (spoilers):
When Emma discovers her husband faked his death and is actually a CIA agent hunting terrorists, she joins his mission and ultimately learns to trust him again after he saves her from the villain.
