CURRENT CHAPTER OUTLINES:
```
{{ old_content }}
```

TASK:
Revise the chapter outlines to address the user's feedback while maintaining story coherence and structure.

GUIDELINES:
1. **Address the Feedback**: Directly implement what the user requested
2. **Maintain Coherence**: Ensure chapters flow logically and build on each other
3. **Preserve What Works**: Don't unnecessarily change chapters not mentioned in feedback
4. **Improve Quality**: Strengthen weak areas while making requested changes
5. **Be Complete**: Return ALL chapters (foundation + all chapter outlines)
6. **Avoid Duplication**: Each chapter should have unique events and progression
7. **Scene-Level Events**: Use 3-5 major scene-level plot points per chapter (not granular beats)

CHAPTER OUTLINE STRUCTURE:
Each chapter should include:
- **Chapter number and title**
- **Summary**: 1-2 sentence chapter overview
- **POV character** (if applicable)
- **Key events**: 3-5 major scene-level plot points that will become full scenes in prose
- **Character development**: How characters change
- **Emotional arc**: Emotional journey of the chapter
- **Connections**: How this chapter connects to overall story

RETURN FORMAT:
Return the complete revised chapter outlines as markdown, separated by `---` markers:

```
# Foundation

[Foundation content with metadata, characters, world]

---

# Chapter 1: [Title]

**Summary:** [1-2 sentence overview]

**POV:** [Character name]

**Key Events:**
1. [Major plot point 1 - will become a full scene]
2. [Major plot point 2 - will become a full scene]
3. [Major plot point 3 - will become a full scene]

**Character Development:**
[How characters grow or change]

**Emotional Arc:**
[Emotional journey]

---

# Chapter 2: [Title]

[Same structure]

---

[Continue for all chapters]
```

IMPORTANT:
- Separate foundation and each chapter with `---` on its own line
- Focus changes on what the user requested
- Maintain narrative progression and avoid duplicate events
- Use 3-5 SCENE-LEVEL events per chapter (each becomes 1000-2000 word scene in prose)
- Ensure each chapter advances the story uniquely
- Temperature is 0.7 for creative but focused iteration
