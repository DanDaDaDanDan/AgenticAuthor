SURGICAL PROSE FIXES FOR CHAPTER {{ chapter_number }}:

The prose below has specific validation issues that need targeted fixes.
Your task is to fix these issues with surgical precision, making minimal changes.

CHAPTER OUTLINE (source of truth):
```yaml
{{ chapter_yaml }}
```

YOUR PREVIOUS PROSE (mostly good - needs targeted fixes):
```
{{ prose_text }}
```

ISSUES TO FIX:

{{ issues_formatted }}

INSTRUCTIONS - BE SURGICAL:
1. Focus primarily on fixing the specific issues listed above
2. Preserve the existing prose quality and voice
3. You may make small adjustments to surrounding content if needed for flow
4. Avoid unnecessary rewrites of working scenes
5. For each issue:
   - Missing scenes: Add the complete scene (not a summary)
   - Skipped development: Develop the character moment fully
   - Wrong POV: Adjust POV perspective as needed
   - Word count deviation: Expand or trim targeted areas
6. Keep the same narrative tone and style
7. Maintain continuity with the rest of the prose

Think of this as surgical editing - fix what's broken with minimal collateral changes.
The goal is targeted fixes that resolve the violations while preserving what works.

Return the corrected prose as flowing narrative text (NOT YAML).

Write the corrected prose as excellent narrative.
Let the content breathe naturally.

Return ONLY the corrected prose text. Do NOT include:
- YAML formatting
- Chapter headers
- Explanations or notes

Just flowing narrative prose.
