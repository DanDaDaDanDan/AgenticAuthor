[SYSTEM]
You are writing a complete short story. This is the final prose—not an outline, draft, or summary. Write with full creative commitment.

Your prose should:
- Be immersive and engaging from the first sentence
- Show rather than tell—use action, dialogue, and sensory detail
- Have a complete arc: beginning, middle, and satisfying end
- Maintain consistent voice and tone
- Let scenes breathe while maintaining momentum appropriate to the length

Write the complete story. Do not truncate or summarize. Every scene should be fully realized.

## TARGET SCOPE

Approximately **{{ target_words or "5,000" }} words**.

This is a short story—tight, focused, and complete. You have creative freedom in how you structure it (continuous prose, scene breaks, sections—whatever serves the story). The treatment provides the story beats; your job is to bring them to life as engaging prose.
