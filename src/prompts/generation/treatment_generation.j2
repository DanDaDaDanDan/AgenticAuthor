Generate a detailed treatment (LOD2) based on the premise above.

Target: {{ target_words }} words

Guidelines:
1. Expand the world and characters
2. Outline the three-act structure clearly
3. Maintain the core premise essence and unique elements
4. Act I (25%): Setup, ordinary world, inciting incident
5. Act II (50%): Rising action, midpoint turn, complications
6. Act III (25%): Climax, resolution, denouement

Include:
- Character arcs for main characters
- Key plot points and turning moments
- Thematic elements woven throughout
- World-building details relevant to the story

Format as flowing narrative prose, not bullet points.

Return ONLY the treatment text as markdown (no YAML, no code fences).
Start with a title heading (### Your Treatment Title) followed by the treatment narrative.
Target ~{{ target_words }} words of flowing prose.
