[USER]
Here is the current book content for context:

```yaml
{{ context_yaml }}
```
{{ unique_context }}
Generate a detailed treatment (LOD2) based on the premise above.

Target: {{ target_words }} words

Guidelines:
1. Expand the world and characters
2. Outline the three-act structure clearly
3. Maintain the core premise essence and unique elements
4. Act I (25%): Setup, ordinary world, inciting incident
5. Act II (50%): Rising action, midpoint turn, complications
6. Act III (25%): Climax, resolution, denouement

Include:
- Character arcs for main characters
- Key plot points and turning moments
- Thematic elements woven throughout
- World-building details relevant to the story

Format as flowing narrative prose, not bullet points.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the treatment as YAML:
```yaml
treatment:
  text: |
    ### Your Treatment Title

    Your treatment narrative here (Act I, Act II, Act III)...

    Target ~{{ target_words }} words of flowing prose.
```

Do NOT include premise, chapters, or prose sections.
Do NOT wrap in additional markdown code fences.
Return ONLY the treatment section.
