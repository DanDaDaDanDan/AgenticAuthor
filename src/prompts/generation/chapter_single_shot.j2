[SYSTEM]
You are a professional story development assistant. You create comprehensive chapter outlines with unique plot events and progressive character development. You write in clear, natural markdown format.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write in clear, natural markdown format. Focus on the story content, not formatting details.

[USER]
Generate a comprehensive chapter structure for a book.

INPUT CONTEXT:
```yaml
{{ context_yaml }}
```

FOUNDATION (already generated):
```yaml
{{ foundation_yaml }}
```

TASK:
Generate {{ chapter_count }} comprehensive chapter outlines for the complete story.
The foundation (metadata, characters, world) has already been generated above.

CRITICAL - PLAN THE COMPLETE ARC:
Since you're generating ALL chapters at once, you have the unique opportunity to:
- Plan the entire story progression before committing to any chapter
- Distribute character development evenly across the arc
- Ensure each chapter has a UNIQUE role in the story
- Avoid duplicating plot beats or character moments
- Create clear causal progression from chapter to chapter

ANTI-REDUNDANCY GUARDRAILS (Act II especially):
- Do not repeat similar operation types (e.g., multiple stakeouts/raids/canvasses). If a pattern would repeat, CONSOLIDATE into a single, higher-impact chapter.
- Vary setting and tactics — escalate stakes and method rather than replaying the same beat.
- Each chapter should introduce at least one new piece of information OR a meaningful turn in relationships.

CHAPTER STRUCTURE:
For each chapter provide:
- number, title (evocative, specific)
- pov, act (Act I/Act II/Act III based on position), summary (3-4 sentences)
- key_events: 3-5 major plot points (each will become a complete scene in prose - UNIQUE to this chapter, not repeated)
- character_developments: 3-4 internal changes (LINEAR progression, no repeated beats). Format each as "Name: concrete change with evidence" (e.g., "Elias: trusts Lena's intuition after failed predictive model").
- relationship_beats: 2-3 relationship evolutions (UNIQUE dynamics)
- tension_points: 2-3 stakes/urgency moments
- sensory_details: 2-3 atmospheric elements
- subplot_threads: 1-2 if applicable

GUIDELINES FOR KEY_EVENTS - CRITICAL:
- Each key_event should be SCENE-LEVEL, not beat-level
- Think: "What are the 3-5 major scenes in this chapter?" NOT "What are all the small beats?"
- Each key_event will expand into a full dramatic scene (1,000-2,000 words) in prose
- Consolidate related beats into a single event (e.g., "Character arrives at location, examines evidence, discovers clue" = ONE event)
- AVOID fragmentation: Don't break a single interaction into multiple events
- Example of TOO GRANULAR (beat-level): "Character arrives", "Character examines body", "Character discovers clue", "Character talks to witness"
- Example of CORRECT (scene-level): "Character examines crime scene, discovering crucial clue while interviewing witness"

ACT DISTRIBUTION & PROGRESSION:
- Act I (~25%): Establish premise, inciting incident, clear story question. No filler scenes.
- Act II (~50%): Escalate through varied strategies (investigation, confrontation, reversal). Avoid repeating the same tactic twice; merge near-duplicate beats.
- Act III (~25%): Execute decisive moves, climax, and resolution with consequences.

GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Each key_event should be specific and complete (not vague or generic)
- Character developments show PROGRESSIVE internal change (no resets or repeats)
- Relationship beats track EVOLVING dynamics (each interaction builds on previous)
- Be specific with names, places, emotions, concrete details
- Act I: ~25% chapters (setup and introduction)
- Act II: ~50% chapters (rising action and complications)
- Act III: ~25% chapters (climax and resolution)

RETURN FORMAT:
Write comprehensive chapter outlines using natural markdown format:

# Chapter 1: [Title]

**POV:** [Character name]
**Act:** Act I/II/III
**Summary:** [3-4 sentence summary of the chapter]

## Key Events
1. [First major scene/plot point that will expand to 1,000-2,000 words]
2. [Second major scene/plot point]
3. [Third major scene/plot point]
4. [Fourth major scene/plot point (optional)]
5. [Fifth major scene/plot point (optional)]

## Character Development
- [Name]: [Concrete internal change with evidence]
- [Name]: [Specific shift caused by a scene outcome]
- [Name]: [Decision that advances arc]

## Relationship Beats
- [First relationship change]
- [Second relationship change]

## Tension Points
- [First tension point]
- [Second tension point]

## Sensory Details
- [First sensory detail]
- [Second sensory detail]

## Subplot Threads
- [First subplot thread (if applicable)]

---

# Chapter 2: [Title]
[Continue the same format for all {{ chapter_count }} chapters]

IMPORTANT:
- Write in natural, readable markdown
- Focus on story content, not formatting perfection
- Each chapter must have UNIQUE plot events (no duplication)
- Character arcs must PROGRESS linearly (no repeated beats)
- Use clear section headers and bullet points
