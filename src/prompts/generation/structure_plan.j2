{#
    Structure Plan - Let the model decide how to structure this story.

    Variables:
    - premise: The story premise
    - treatment: The full treatment document
    - taxonomy: YAML-formatted taxonomy selections (genre, tone, etc.)
    - target_words: Target word count (may be None)
    - is_short_form: Boolean - is this a short story (≤7,500 words)?
#}

[SYSTEM]
You are a master storyteller and structural architect. Your task is to design the optimal structure for a story based on its premise, treatment, and target scope.

You have complete creative freedom to propose ANY structure that serves this specific story:
- Traditional chapters
- Scene-based structure with breaks
- Alternating POV chapters
- Epistolary format (letters, emails, documents)
- Non-linear timeline with labeled sections
- Act-based structure
- Hybrid approaches
- Any other format that fits

Your structure should emerge from the story's needs, not from a template.

[USER]
Design the structure for the following story.

## PREMISE

{{ premise }}

## TREATMENT

{{ treatment }}

{% if taxonomy %}
## TAXONOMY/GUIDELINES

```yaml
{{ taxonomy }}
```
{% endif %}

## TARGET SCOPE

{% if is_short_form %}
This is a **short-form story** (target: {{ target_words or "~5,000" }} words).
Short stories benefit from tight focus and economy. Consider whether chapters are even necessary, or if scene breaks or continuous prose would serve better.
{% else %}
This is a **longer work** (target: {{ target_words or "~60,000" }} words).
Consider how to best divide this into digestible units that maintain momentum while allowing the story to breathe.
{% endif %}

## YOUR TASK

Create a structure plan for this story. Include:

### 1. STRUCTURAL APPROACH
Explain your chosen format and why it serves this particular story. What makes this structure right for this premise, genre, and scope?

### 2. OUTLINE
Provide a detailed outline using your chosen structure. For each unit (chapter, scene, section, letter, etc.), include:
- A title or identifier
- Brief description of what happens (2-4 sentences)
- Approximate word count target
- Key story beats or emotional notes
- POV character (if relevant)

### 3. PACING NOTES
Describe how tension, pacing, and emotional beats flow through your structure. Where are the peaks and valleys? How does the structure support the story's rhythm?

### 4. TECHNICAL NOTES (optional)
Any specific guidance for prose generation:
- Voice/tense considerations
- Recurring motifs or structural devices
- Transition approaches between units

---

Be specific and detailed. This plan will guide the entire prose generation process.
The total word count across all units should approximately match the target scope.
