Rate the quality and provide constructive criticism. Focus on what matters most to making this better.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Check for duplicate plot elements:
- Duplicate events across different chapters (e.g., "alliance formed" in Ch 6 AND Ch 10)
- Repeated character moments or developments
- Redundant scenes covering the same story beats
- Structural repetition (two chapters doing essentially the same thing)
If you find duplicates, note them SPECIFICALLY in feedback (e.g., "Ch 6 'Alliance of Thieves' and Ch 10 'Manchester Accord' both cover the same alliance formation event - consolidate into one chapter")

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "grade": "A+ (Exceptional) | A (Excellent) | B+ (Very Good) | B (Good) | C+ (Above Average) | C (Average) | D+ (Below Average) | D (Poor) | F (Needs Major Revision)",
  "grade_justification": "one sentence explaining the grade",
  "overall_assessment": "2-3 sentences on overall quality",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "category": "Pacing|Character|Plot|Structure|Dialogue|Worldbuilding|Tone|etc",
      "location": "specific chapter/section (e.g., 'Chapter 5', 'Act II', 'Chapters 9-11')",
      "description": "clear explanation of what's wrong",
      "impact": "how this weakens the story",
      "suggestion": "specific actionable fix (be concrete: 'consolidate chapters 9-11', 'add scene showing X in chapter 4', etc)"
    }
  ],
  "strengths": [
    "What works well in this story",
    ...
  ],
  "next_steps": "Single most impactful change to improve this {{ content_type }}"
}

⚠️ CRITICAL: For every issue identified, you MUST provide a SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE suggestion.
- BAD: "improve pacing" | "fix character development" | "make it better"
- GOOD: "consolidate chapters 9-11 into single chapter" | "add flashback scene in chapter 4 showing protagonist's childhood trauma" | "move alliance formation from chapter 10 to chapter 6"

Be honest, specific, and constructive. Focus on impact, not minutiae. Limit to 5-7 most impactful issues.
