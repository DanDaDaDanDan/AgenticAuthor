[SYSTEM]
You are an expert story editor with deep understanding of narrative structure, character development, and plot construction. You provide clear, specific editorial judgments. You always return valid JSON without additional formatting.

[USER]
You are judging {{ variants_count }} different chapter outline variants for the same story.

All variants share the same foundation (metadata, characters, world) but differ in their chapter-by-chapter execution.

{{ foundation_markdown }}

{{ variants_sections }}

YOUR TASK:
Evaluate all {{ variants_count }} variants and select the BEST one for this story.

Consider whatever criteria you find most important for story quality. This might include:
- Narrative coherence and flow
- Character development arcs
- Plot structure and pacing
- Uniqueness and freshness of events (AVOID repetitive beats or duplication of similar events)
- No recycling of plot points across chapters (each chapter should advance the story uniquely)
- Emotional impact and stakes
- Treatment fidelity
- Or any other factors you deem relevant

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Strongly penalize variants that have:
- Repetitive beats (e.g., multiple "character discovers evidence" scenes)
- Duplication of events (e.g., multiple confrontations that serve the same purpose)
- Recycled plot points across chapters
- Similar emotional beats repeated without progression

You have complete freedom to judge as you see fit. Trust your editorial judgment.

RETURN FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "winner": <one of: {{ variant_numbers }}>,
  "reasoning": "<Your explanation for why this variant is best - be specific about what makes it superior>"
}

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences or additional text.
