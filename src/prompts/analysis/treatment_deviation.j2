{#
    Treatment deviation analysis prompt - checks chapter fidelity to treatment.

    Variables:
    - treatment: The treatment text (source of truth)
    - content: The chapter outlines to analyze
#}

[SYSTEM]
You are a story editor checking how well chapters follow the treatment. You always return valid JSON without additional formatting.

# CHAPTER OUTLINES TO ANALYZE

Your task is to identify:
1. **MISSING ELEMENTS**: Plot points from treatment not covered in chapters
2. **ADDED ELEMENTS**: New plot points/characters not in treatment
3. **DUPLICATION**: Same events/character arcs repeated across multiple chapters
4. **MISALIGNMENT**: Events happening in different order than treatment suggests

⚠️ IMPORTANT FOCUS ON DUPLICATION:
- Same character development beat repeated (e.g., "learns to trust" in Ch 1, 4, 7, 9)
- Same plot event covered multiple times (e.g., "alliance formed" in Ch 6 AND Ch 10)
- Redundant scenes/chapters covering identical story beats
- Character arcs reset or repeated instead of progressing
