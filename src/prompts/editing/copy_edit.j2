COPY EDITING SCOPE - KEY GUIDELINES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ YOU MUST FIX:
  • Grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, etc.)
  • Spelling mistakes and typos
  • Punctuation errors (commas, semicolons, dialogue formatting)
  • Inconsistent character details across chapters
    - Names, physical descriptions, ages
    - Pronoun consistency (especially with unisex names!)
    - Character voice and speech patterns
  • Timeline contradictions with other chapters
  • Unclear or ambiguous sentences that confuse readers
  • Inconsistent terminology or proper nouns
  • Dialogue formatting issues
  • Awkward or confusing sentence structures
  • Factual continuity errors with other chapters

✗ YOU MUST NOT CHANGE:
  • Plot events or story structure
  • Character personalities, motivations, or arcs
  • Dialogue CONTENT (only fix formatting/grammar)
  • Author's narrative voice or stylistic choices
  • Scene order, pacing, or dramatic beats
  • Creative choices that aren't actual errors

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ IMPORTANT: PRONOUN CONSISTENCY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Pay special attention to character pronouns:
- If a character has a unisex name (Alex, Jordan, Sam, etc.), verify pronouns match other chapters
- Check for accidental pronoun switches within a chapter
- Ensure "they" is used consistently if character is non-binary
- Flag any ambiguous pronoun usage that could confuse readers

Example issues to catch:
❌ "Alex walked in. She looked around. He sat down." (inconsistent)
✓ "Alex walked in. He looked around. He sat down." (consistent)

❌ "Sam and Jordan talked. She agreed with him." (ambiguous - who is she/him?)
✓ "Sam and Jordan talked. Sam agreed with Jordan." (clear)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STORY STRUCTURE (chapters.yaml - self-contained reference)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{{ chapters_markdown }}

This contains:
- metadata: genre, tone, themes, pacing, narrative style
- characters: full profiles, backgrounds, motivations, arcs, relationships
- world: setting, locations, systems, atmosphere
- chapters: detailed outlines for all chapters

Use this for:
- Character consistency (names, descriptions, pronouns, relationships)
- World-building details
- Timeline and plot progression
- Thematic consistency

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EDITED CHAPTERS (perfect versions for consistency reference)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{{ edited_chapters_text if edited_chapters_text else "No chapters edited yet - this is the first chapter." }}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REMAINING CHAPTERS (original versions for forward reference)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{{ remaining_chapters_text if remaining_chapters_text else "No remaining chapters - this is the last chapter." }}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CURRENT CHAPTER PROSE TO EDIT (Chapter {{ chapter_num }})

{{ current_chapter_text }}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EDITING PROCESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Read current chapter carefully
2. Cross-reference with previous edited chapters for:
   - Character consistency (names, descriptions, pronouns)
   - Timeline continuity
   - Terminology consistency
   - Character voice patterns
3. Fix all mechanical errors (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
4. Clarify confusing or ambiguous sentences
5. Ensure dialogue formatting is correct and consistent
6. Verify pronoun usage is consistent and unambiguous
7. Maintain the author's voice throughout

EDITING EXAMPLES:

GOOD EDITS (these are appropriate):
Before: "Sarah walked in the room, her eyes scanning the crowed."
After: "Sarah walked into the room, her eyes scanning the crowd."
Why: Fixed preposition and spelling error

Before: He said "I don't know."
After: He said, "I don't know."
Why: Added comma before dialogue (standard formatting)

Before: "Alex grabbed his coat. She ran out the door."
After: "Alex grabbed his coat. He ran out the door."
Why: Fixed pronoun inconsistency (Alex is male based on previous chapters)

Before: "The detective examined the clues. They were confusing."
After: "The detective examined the clues. The evidence was confusing."
Why: Clarified ambiguous "they" - could mean detective or clues

BAD EDITS (don't do these):
Before: "Sarah walked into the room."
After: "Sarah strode confidently into the spacious room."
Why WRONG: Added details and changed author's voice

Before: "He was angry."
After: "He was furious."
Why WRONG: Changed emotional intensity without author's intent

Before: "It was raining."
After: "It was a dark and stormy night."
Why WRONG: Embellished beyond fixing an error

REMEMBER:
- This is copy editing the PROSE ONLY, NOT creative rewriting
- You are NOT editing premise_metadata.json, treatment.md, or chapters.yaml - those are read-only reference
- Preserve the author's voice and creative choices
- Fix errors and ensure consistency
- When in doubt about a creative choice vs an error, flag it for review
- Pay special attention to pronoun consistency across all chapters
