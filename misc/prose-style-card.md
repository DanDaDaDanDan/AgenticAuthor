CLARITY-FIRST HOUSE STYLE
Voice: lean, vivid, modern. Ornament supports momentum.
Cadence: average 14–18 words/sentence; cut strings of subordinate clauses in action.
Metaphors: ≤1 per paragraph; prefer image→action sequencing.
Anchors: Scene opens must state who/where/goal within 2 sentences.
Tech gloss: after any adjustment, add a 1-line plain result (“it runs cooler; it won’t arc”).
Re-intro: after ~400 words of absence, re-tag a returning character with a quick role appositive.
Dialogue: simple tags (“said/asked”); beat every 3–5 exchanges.
Paragraphs: ≤5 lines on laptop; split interior ruminations.
Theme levers: paper vs. power; truth vs. print; keep them present but never at the expense of clarity.
