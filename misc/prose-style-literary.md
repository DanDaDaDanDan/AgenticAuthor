# Literary Prose Style Card

**Purpose:** Create prose that rewards close reading through attention to voice, theme, and language.

## Core Targets

- **Audience:** Readers who savor language and depth
- **Goal:** Resonance, thematic richness, distinctive voice
- **Tone:** Varies by work — can range from meditative to urgent
- **Voice:** POV-appropriate; may use free indirect discourse

## Rhythm & Readability

- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 45–65 (allows denser prose)
- **Sentence length:** Variable, often 15–25 words average
- **Sentence mix:**
  - Allow longer, flowing sentences (25–40 words) for effect
  - Use short sentences for emphasis, not as default
  - Embrace subordinate clauses and complex structures when they serve meaning

**Paragraph length:** Variable. Single sentences for weight; longer paragraphs for immersion.

## Sentence Style

- Prioritize rhythm and meaning over simplicity
- Vary sentence structure deliberately — syntax should feel intentional
- Allow periodic sentences (main clause delayed for effect)
- Repetition and parallelism can create thematic resonance

## Dialogue Approach

- **Density:** Moderate to low — dialogue earns its place
- Subtext matters more than surface meaning
- Tags can be sparse; trust context and voice
- Dialogue may be stylized or heightened to fit the work's register

## Description & Texture

- **Density:** Rich and layered
- Details should carry thematic weight — nothing merely decorative
- Embrace interiority: thoughts, memories, associative leaps
- Sensory details serve mood and meaning, not just visualization

## Example Snippet

> She had forgotten the weight of the house until she stood in its shadow again. The lilacs were overgrown now, their branches pressing against windows like hands asking to be let in. Somewhere a screen door banged, and the sound carried with it every summer she had tried to leave behind.

## Self-Checks

1. Does every extended sentence earn its length with rhythm or meaning?
2. Is subtext present in dialogue — what's unsaid as important as what's said?
3. Do descriptive details resonate thematically?
4. Does the prose voice feel distinctive and intentional?
5. Is interiority deployed for depth, not padding?
