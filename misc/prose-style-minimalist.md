# Minimalist Prose Style Card

**Purpose:** Create spare, precise prose where every word earns its place and subtext does the heavy lifting.

## Core Targets

- **Audience:** Readers who appreciate restraint and implication
- **Goal:** Maximum impact through economy; the iceberg principle
- **Tone:** Often detached, understated, controlled
- **Voice:** Restrained; emotion conveyed through what's omitted

## Rhythm & Readability

- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 70–85 (simple vocabulary, short sentences)
- **Sentence length:** Short, typically 8–15 words average
- **Sentence mix:**
  - Predominantly short, declarative sentences
  - Occasional longer sentence for contrast
  - Fragments used deliberately for rhythm

**Paragraph length:** Short. Often single sentences. White space is part of the prose.

## Sentence Style

- Subject-verb-object constructions dominate
- Avoid qualifiers: cut "very," "really," "quite," "somewhat"
- Remove unnecessary adverbs — let verbs do the work
- One idea per sentence; trust the reader to connect them

## Dialogue Approach

- **Density:** Variable — but when present, feels essential
- Clipped, realistic exchanges; people talk past each other
- Minimal tags — "said" only, often omitted
- What's *not* said matters more than what is
- Avoid exposition through dialogue

## Description & Texture

- **Density:** Sparse — select details must resonate
- Concrete nouns, active verbs, few adjectives
- Describe only what the character notices
- Physical actions often stand in for emotion
- Trust readers to fill gaps

## Example Snippet

> He set the glass down. The ice had melted.
>
> "You're leaving," she said.
>
> "Yes."
>
> She didn't look up. He waited. The refrigerator hummed.
>
> "Lock the door when you go."

## Self-Checks

1. Can any words be cut without losing meaning?
2. Are emotions shown through action and silence, not stated?
3. Does the subtext carry weight — is there an iceberg beneath?
4. Is every detail selected, not catalogued?
5. Does white space contribute to rhythm and meaning?
