# Mass Market Prose Style Card

**Purpose:** Optimize narrative prose for readability, emotional accessibility, and mass-market appeal.  
**Do not imitate** any living author’s exact voice; focus on clarity, pacing, and engagement.

## 1. Core Targets

- **Audience:** General adult readers (wide market, age 16+).  
- **Goal:** High clarity, emotional immediacy, smooth pacing, and strong reader immersion.  
- **Tone:** Modern, natural, and emotionally legible.  
- **Voice:** Simple past tense.

## 2. Readability Metrics

- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 60–80  
- **Approx. grade level:** 6–8  
- **Average sentence length:** 12–16 words  
- **Sentence mix (per ~500 words):**
  - 60–70% short to mid (9–17 words)  
  - 20% longer (18–25 words)  
  - 10% very short (1–8 words) for punch

**Paragraph length:** 1–3 sentences average.  
Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis or emotional beats.

## 3. Language & Diction

- Use **high-frequency, concrete words**.  
- Prefer **verbs over adverbs**, **nouns over adjectives**.  
- Use **contractions** freely in narration and dialogue.  
- Avoid ornate or archaic phrasing.  
- Keep vocabulary concrete and image-driven.  
- Include **2–3 sensory details** per 200 words.  
- Limit figurative language to **1 simple simile/metaphor per 200 words**.

## 4. Cohesion & Flow

- Connect ideas with **and, but, because, so, while, if**.  
- Avoid sentence fragments unless used deliberately for rhythm.  
- Vary rhythm to avoid monotony.

## 5. Dialogue Rules

- **Target:** 35–50% of lines in character-heavy scenes.  
- **Tags:** Use *said* and *asked* by default.  
- **Avoid:** Adverbs after tags (no “she said softly”).  
- Prefer **action beats** to show tone or emotion.  
- Omit tags when the speaker is obvious.  
- Keep spoken language simple, rhythmic, and emotionally direct.

## 6. Point of View & Tense

- One POV per scene.  
- Simple past tense unless specified.  
- Occasional *free indirect style* for inner thoughts.

## 7. Pacing Structure (POISE)

A useful micro-arc for plot-driving scenes:

**P** – POV character's clear **Objective**
**O** – An **Obstacle** or new friction appears
**I** – Character **Interacts / acts** toward the goal
**S** – **Stakes rise** (tension or emotional risk increases)
**E** – Scene **Ends with a turn** (reveal, question, decision, or new goal)

**POISE works well for:** Action sequences, confrontations, plot-advancing scenes.

**POISE may be relaxed for:** Reflective moments, atmospheric interludes, character-building scenes, denouement. Not every scene needs escalating stakes—some need breathing room.

## 8. Sentence & Paragraph Self-Checks

Before completing, review:

1. Any sentence over **35 words** → shorten or justify rhythmically.  
2. Any dialogue tag with an adverb → replace with an action beat.  
3. Confirm last line of each section creates a *turn* (question, choice, or reveal).  
4. Ensure at least **two sensory anchors** per 200 words.  
5. Maintain consistent POV without drift.

## 9. Example Output Snippet

> The key turned, but the door stuck. Maya leaned her shoulder into the wood and felt it give a little—just enough to smell the dust inside.  
> “You sure this is the right place?” she asked.  
> The hallway behind them hummed with the old pipes. She tried again. The lock clicked. The door swung open.  
> Something scuffed across the floor in the dark.

*(Sentence mix, natural rhythm, sensory detail, clean dialogue.)*

## 10. Final Checklist

| Category | Target | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Flesch Reading Ease | 60–80 | Natural prose zone |
| Dialogue Ratio | 35–50% | For pacing |
| Sentence Avg | 12–16 words | Short-to-mid |
| POV | One per scene | No head hopping |
| Scene End | Should contain a “turn” | Keeps pages turning |

## 11. Meta-Instruction

- **Use this style card as guidance for mass-market accessibility.**
- The metrics are targets, not rigid requirements—deviate when it serves the story.
- Before finalizing, consider the **Sentence & Paragraph Self-Checks** as guidelines.
- If conflicts arise, **clarity and flow take priority** over ornamentation.

**When to deviate:**
- Literary fiction may use longer sentences, denser prose, fewer dialogue tags
- Atmospheric scenes may prioritize mood over momentum
- Distinctive character voices may break readability rules deliberately
- Genre conventions may call for different pacing (thriller vs literary vs romance)

The goal is engaging, readable prose—not mechanical conformity.
