# Lyrical/Atmospheric Prose Style Card

**Purpose:** Create poetic prose that prioritizes mood, beauty, and sensory immersion over rapid plot advancement.

## Core Targets

- **Audience:** Readers who want to inhabit a mood and savor language
- **Goal:** Atmosphere, emotional resonance, sensory richness
- **Tone:** Dreamlike, evocative, emotionally saturated
- **Voice:** Immersive; may blend perception, memory, and thought

## Rhythm & Readability

- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 50–70 (allows poetic complexity)
- **Sentence length:** Variable, often 18–30 words average
- **Sentence mix:**
  - Flowing sentences that build and crest
  - Repetition and parallelism for musical effect
  - Short sentences for punctuation, not dominance

**Paragraph length:** Often longer. Let prose breathe and accumulate.

## Sentence Style

- Prioritize rhythm — read sentences aloud for musicality
- Embrace cumulative sentences that layer images
- Alliteration, assonance, and consonance enhance without calling attention
- Periodic sentences can build to emotional release
- Lists and catalogues can create hypnotic effect

## Dialogue Approach

- **Density:** Low to moderate — dialogue emerges from atmosphere
- May be stylized or heightened to match the prose register
- Can integrate with narrative, blurring the line
- What characters say should feel inevitable, not transactional
- Silence and pause carry meaning

## Description & Texture

- **Density:** Lush — this style lives in description
- Layer sensory details: sight, sound, smell, texture, taste
- Synesthesia welcome (sounds that feel like colors)
- Nature and weather often carry emotional weight
- Memory and present moment can blur
- Details should evoke, not merely document

## Example Snippet

> The fog came in with the evening, soft and gray, filling the hollows between the hills like water rising. She stood at the window and watched the world dissolve — first the orchard, then the road, then the place where the road met the sky. Somewhere a bell was ringing, or had rung, or would ring. She couldn't tell anymore which memories were hers.

## Self-Checks

1. Does the prose create a tangible mood or atmosphere?
2. Are sensory details layered and evocative, not merely listed?
3. Does sentence rhythm feel musical when read aloud?
4. Is the emotional register consistent throughout?
5. Does description deepen meaning, not just decorate?
