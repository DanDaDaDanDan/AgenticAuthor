# Conversational/Voice-Driven Prose Style Card

**Purpose:** Create prose with a strong narrative voice that feels like someone telling you a story directly.

## Core Targets

- **Audience:** Readers who connect with personality and voice
- **Goal:** Intimacy, authenticity, a distinctive narrator you want to spend time with
- **Tone:** Personal, often informal, character-saturated
- **Voice:** First person or close third with strong personality in the prose itself

## Rhythm & Readability

- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 65–80 (natural speech patterns)
- **Sentence length:** Variable, mimicking natural speech
- **Sentence mix:**
  - Mix short punchy observations with longer rambling thoughts
  - Fragments common — people don't speak in complete sentences
  - Asides, digressions, and parentheticals welcome

**Paragraph length:** Variable. Mirrors how the narrator thinks — sometimes rapid-fire, sometimes lingering.

## Sentence Style

- Natural speech rhythms trump grammatical correctness
- Contractions always; formality only for effect
- Starts with "And" or "But" — because that's how people think
- Rhetorical questions engage the reader directly
- Personality shows in syntax choices

## Dialogue Approach

- **Density:** Often high — this style loves voices
- Each character needs a distinct speech pattern
- Narrator voice and character voices should feel different
- Tags can be playful; action beats show personality
- Banter, interruptions, and unfinished sentences feel real

## Description & Texture

- **Density:** Filtered through narrator's personality
- The narrator notices what *they* would notice
- Opinions, judgments, and asides color description
- Similes and metaphors reflect the narrator's worldview
- World-building happens through voice, not exposition

## Example Snippet

> Here's the thing about my sister: she could make a gas station bathroom feel like a crime scene. Not literally — though I wouldn't put it past her — but in that way where you walked in and just *knew* something had happened. Some kind of emotional detonation.
>
> "You're being dramatic," she'd say.
>
> Yeah. Wonder where I learned that.

## Self-Checks

1. Does the narrative voice feel consistent and distinctive?
2. Would you recognize this narrator's prose without context?
3. Are observations filtered through personality, not neutral?
4. Do different characters sound different from each other — and from the narrator?
5. Does the prose invite the reader in, like being told a story?
