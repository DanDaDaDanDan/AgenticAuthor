# Pulp/Action Prose Style Card

**Purpose:** Create fast, punchy prose that prioritizes momentum, excitement, and visceral engagement.

## Core Targets

- **Audience:** Readers who want to be swept along
- **Goal:** Relentless forward momentum; page-turning urgency
- **Tone:** High-energy, visceral, immediate
- **Voice:** Close and in-the-moment; the reader should feel the punches

## Rhythm & Readability

- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 70–85 (accessible, fast)
- **Sentence length:** Short, typically 8–14 words average
- **Sentence mix:**
  - Heavy on short, punchy sentences (5–12 words)
  - Fragments encouraged for impact
  - Longer sentences only to build before a snap

**Paragraph length:** Short. 1–2 sentences common. Rapid-fire in action sequences.

## Sentence Style

- Action verbs drive everything — punch, grab, slam, sprint
- Front-load with action: "He ducked" not "Ducking, he..."
- Fragments for impact: "Glass everywhere. Blood on his knuckles. No time."
- Staccato rhythm in action; build tension with slight elongation before release

## Dialogue Approach

- **Density:** High in confrontation scenes
- Snappy, quippy exchanges — characters talk fast
- Minimal tags; action beats preferred
- One-liners welcome; wit under pressure
- Keep speeches short — no monologuing during fights

## Description & Texture

- **Density:** Quick strokes — just enough to see the scene
- Visceral, physical details: sweat, impact, smell of cordite
- Skip setup; drop readers into the action
- Setting through motion: describe what the character interacts with
- Sensory focus on what hurts, threatens, or thrills

## Example Snippet

> The door exploded inward. Marcus rolled, came up shooting. Two down. Three more behind the bar.
>
> "That all you got?" He didn't wait for an answer.
>
> Glass shattered. Someone screamed. His shoulder hit the wall, but his finger was already on the trigger.
>
> Click.
>
> Empty.

## Self-Checks

1. Does every scene have forward momentum?
2. Are action verbs doing the heavy lifting?
3. Do dialogue exchanges crackle — no dead air?
4. Is description kinetic, not static?
5. Does the prose make you want to read faster?
